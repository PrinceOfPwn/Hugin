## Summary
This technique covers the concepts surrounding Binary Patching as Standalone Offensive Capability. It represents a synthesized view of the identified research gap `binary-patching-memory-and-disk` and highlights key operational mechanisms for red team operators.

## Technical Deep Dive
Documents binary patching as a discrete operational concept: modifying binaries on disk or in memory to change execution behavior. Memory patching: NTDLL unhook (T-016 byte-level), AMSI patch (AmsiScanBuffer prologue → ret), ETW patch (NtTraceEvent prologue → ret). Disk patching: persisting a modified PE on disk (e.g., patching an Import Directory or adding an export to enable IAT hijack on next load), or modifying a signed-but-relaxed binary's checksum-adjusted bytes. SEC670 lists this as a discrete Red Team Tools capability; the vault references patching implicitly inside T-016 but does not document it as a unified capability with the byte-alignment, checksum, and signature-discipline considerations that distinguish memory from disk patching.

At a deeper API level, this involves understanding the specific structures and offsets associated with binary-patching-memory-and-disk. Operators must carefully navigate the constraints of the target environment to successfully execute the primitive.

```c
// Procedurally generated example code structure
NTSTATUS Status;
HANDLE hProcess;
OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES ObjectAttributes;
InitializeObjectAttributes(&ObjectAttributes, NULL, 0, NULL, NULL);
// Execution logic here
```

## Evidence
- Synthesized from research gap cluster `binary-patching-memory-and-disk`.
- Addresses foundational concepts needed for advanced evasion and persistence mechanisms.

## Detection & Mitigation
- **ETW Providers**: Monitor relevant ETW providers such as `Microsoft-Windows-Threat-Intelligence` for anomalous API calls.
- **Sysmon**: Configure Sysmon to log detailed process creation and API access events.
- **Preventive Controls**: Implement strict WDAC (Windows Defender Application Control) rules to restrict unsigned code execution.
