## Summary
This technique covers the concepts surrounding x64 ABI, Shadow Space, and Calling Convention for Syscall Stubs. It represents a synthesized view of the identified research gap `x64-abi-syscall-stub-construction` and highlights key operational mechanisms for red team operators.

## Technical Deep Dive
Reference card documenting the x64 ABI as it constrains syscall stubs and ROP frames. Arguments flow in RCX, RDX, R8, R9, then stack; the caller must reserve a 32-byte shadow store at RSP+0..RSP+20h (eight 8-byte slots) for the callee to spill those four register arguments into. Syscall stubs must respect this even when they merely load the SSN into EAX and execute `syscall` — Ekko (T-005) and direct-syscall stubs from T-002 both rely on the shadow store being writable. ROP frame construction for syscall gadgets must similarly allocate the shadow store before the gadget's epilogue reads back the spilled arguments. Note this is distinct from the hardware Shadow Stack (Intel CET) enforcement.

At a deeper API level, this involves understanding the specific structures and offsets associated with x64-abi-syscall-stub-construction. Operators must carefully navigate the constraints of the target environment to successfully execute the primitive.

```c
// Procedurally generated example code structure
NTSTATUS Status;
HANDLE hProcess;
OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES ObjectAttributes;
InitializeObjectAttributes(&ObjectAttributes, NULL, 0, NULL, NULL);
// Execution logic here
```

## Evidence
- Synthesized from research gap cluster `x64-abi-syscall-stub-construction`.
- Addresses foundational concepts needed for advanced evasion and persistence mechanisms.

## Detection & Mitigation
- **ETW Providers**: Monitor relevant ETW providers such as `Microsoft-Windows-Threat-Intelligence` for anomalous API calls.
- **Sysmon**: Configure Sysmon to log detailed process creation and API access events.
- **Preventive Controls**: Implement strict WDAC (Windows Defender Application Control) rules to restrict unsigned code execution.
