## Summary
This technique covers the concepts surrounding GUI Syscall Path via win32u.dll and win32k.sys. It represents a synthesized view of the identified research gap `gui-syscall-path-win32u-win32k` and highlights key operational mechanisms for red team operators.

## Technical Deep Dive
Documents that Windows splits syscall routing into native (ntdll.dll → ntoskrnl.exe / executive) and GUI (win32u.dll → win32k.sys) paths. EDRs hook both; GUI functions like NtUserOpenClipboard, NtUserFindWindowEx, NtUserMessageCall are dispatched through win32u, not ntdll, so a T-016 ntdll unhook does NOT restore clean access to GUI primitives. Thread type matters: a non-GUI thread (no Win32k attributed) issuing a win32k syscall will be rejected; this is enforced by the thread's Win32Thread (THREADINFO) field being NULL. Operators issuing clipboard, window, or input syscalls must ensure the calling thread is GUI-initialized (called User32!Win32InitializeThunk or otherwise have an associated W32THREAD).

At a deeper API level, this involves understanding the specific structures and offsets associated with gui-syscall-path-win32u-win32k. Operators must carefully navigate the constraints of the target environment to successfully execute the primitive.

```c
// Procedurally generated example code structure
NTSTATUS Status;
HANDLE hProcess;
OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES ObjectAttributes;
InitializeObjectAttributes(&ObjectAttributes, NULL, 0, NULL, NULL);
// Execution logic here
```

## Evidence
- Synthesized from research gap cluster `gui-syscall-path-win32u-win32k`.
- Addresses foundational concepts needed for advanced evasion and persistence mechanisms.

## Detection & Mitigation
- **ETW Providers**: Monitor relevant ETW providers such as `Microsoft-Windows-Threat-Intelligence` for anomalous API calls.
- **Sysmon**: Configure Sysmon to log detailed process creation and API access events.
- **Preventive Controls**: Implement strict WDAC (Windows Defender Application Control) rules to restrict unsigned code execution.
