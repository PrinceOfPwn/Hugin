## Summary
Documents SysWhispers3 as the canonical external tooling for SSN-stub generation, with its supported evasion modes: WoW64 stubs (for Heaven's Gate-style transitions), egg-hunter SSN resolution (the `YW...` egg pattern scanned at runtime in ntdll .text), direct syscall jumps in WoW64 and x64, and indirect syscall jumps (calling into ntdll's own `syscall; ret` gadget to defeat kernel call-stack checks). Reference card rather than a how-to; vault's own T-002 implementation should be cross-referenced against SysWhispers3's feature set so operators know what capability parity exists.

### Technical Anchor
SysWhispers3 stub modes: WoW64, egg-hunter (`@__Nt` egg pattern), direct `syscall` in user stub, indirect `jmp` into ntdll `syscall; ret` gadget
